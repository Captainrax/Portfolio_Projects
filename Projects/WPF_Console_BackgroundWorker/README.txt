one of the App's may crash, saying another process is using this file.
this is fixed by simply restarting the program. (i dont know why this, happens other than the obvious).

(i recommend dragging the premade savefolder to AppData/Roaming Manually.)
sometimes the savefolder/file isnt created properly,
once the program crashes once it should create the file properly.
(though the json formating is wrong(missing []) if created via the console app).

the console app "list" command may not work right away if new object is created from WPF app,
Pressing the "update" button in the WPF app makes the console list command update correctly.
